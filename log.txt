Thought about storing class information in nested dictionaries.
This wouldnâ€™t scale as I'd like, so I am now considering using a 
hash table to simply map fields to place in array -> this way, if any 
new fields were to be added, we could simply add on to the hash table.
We could add on to the hash table every time. I considered keeping 
fields in an array and doing .index(.find('field')) every time, but if 
we mix up orders, it could get messy again -> I'll just use a hash table.
